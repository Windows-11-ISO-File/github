Windows 11 removes some of its features from Windows 11, while adding and improving others. The taskbar features a simpler design with centered icons. The Start menu has also been simplified to display frequently used apps and new installations. Search is faster, and a new Widgets section is available for viewing news, weather, and the stock market.

In terms of functionality, Windows 11 includes many new and interesting features, such as the ability to launch Android apps automatically. Windows can also be reconfigured more quickly thanks to Snap Layout.

The operating system also features a modern Fluent Design design. Windows and apps feature simple gradient backgrounds and rounded corners. Many system apps, such as Notepad, Alarms, Clock, and Windows Media Player, have also been completely redesigned.

In terms of security, there’s now a Sandbox. It allows you to run programs in an isolated environment to avoid introducing malware to your entire computer. As expected, this new version of Windows features newer, more modern, and simpler sounds that are less annoying.
